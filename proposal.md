#Token: ERC721x

#Use Cases: A decentralized gaming ecosystem, where users can create their own mods

#Description: Create a dApp backend that will work with a Virtual Reality game on the frontend. Tokens will be ‘physical’ objects in the game, that can be exchanged, and validated on the blockchain

#High Level Plan: Diamonds are made under pressure (usually from pushing down on you, pushing down on me). I won’t be tackling the VR frontend, but I should have a working Version 1 for the blockchain ‘API’ in time.
