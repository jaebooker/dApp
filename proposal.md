#Token: ERC721

#Use Cases: A backend for an AR app, where users can find & trade digital artifacts by searching for them in the real world

#Description: Create a dApp backend that will work with an Augmented Reality app on the frontend. Tokens will be ‘physical’ objects in the app, that can be exchanged, and validated on the blockchain. Like a GeoCache, this 'AR Cache' will allow users to find AR boxes hidden all over the world, and retrieve AR objects stored in them, backed by ERC721 tokens. They will also be able to exchange these objects

#High Level Plan: Diamonds are made under pressure (usually from pushing down on you, pushing down on me). I already have a lot of the AR frontend, and I should have a working Version 1 for the blockchain ABI in time.
